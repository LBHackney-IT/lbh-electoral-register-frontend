# Electoral Register Frontend

This is a web frontend for managing the electoral register for the London Borough of Hackney.

The project is currently at a proof-of-concept stage, with the aim of demonstrating the feasibility of replacing the current Xpress EMS system with a cloud-native system that is able to meet security standards, and avoids licensing fees.

Weeknotes for the project can be found in Google Currents under the tag #ElectionManagementSystem.
